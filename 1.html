<h2>Designer</h2>
<a href="https://between.us/team" target="_blank" title="VCNC team"><strong>Grace</strong> is a VCNC designer</a> who longs for Between to become a brand that is loved by all. She also spends her time thinking about <strong>what designs are characteristically <u>"Between."</u></strong> Her specialties include, making various facial expressions and her lowkey enthusiasm, which is helping her expand non-verbal communication within VCNC. She is very adamant when it comes to injustices, but (to be honest) she possesses a deep well of sensitivity that causes her to tear up when watching whales swim across the wide Atlantic. She loves the world and dreams of world peace!
